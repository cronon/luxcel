                Complexity. That is reason enough to avoid deep nesting.
                It`s not hard to avoid deep nesting. If you have deep nesting, you can redesign
                the tests performed in the if and else clauses or you can break code into simpler
                routines. The following sections present several ways to reduce the nesting
                depth.
                Simplify a nested if by retesting part of the condition
              p.
                If the nesting gets too deep, you can decrease the number of nesting levels by
                retesting some of the conditions. Here’s a code example with nesting that’s deep
                enough to warrant restructuring:
